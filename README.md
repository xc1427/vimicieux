# vimicieux
Personal vim settings.

I used to be a hardcore vimer. Now I switched to IntelliJ IDEA and VSCode/Cursor. Mostly because vim lacks some important modern IDE features. When I managed to configure it right, I feel overwhelmed.

For the moment, I occasionally use vim for instant file viewing / editing / scripting.

## How To Use

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/xc1427/vimicieux.git
echo "source ~/vimicieux/vimfile/sensible_cxi.vim" >> .vimrc
```



## About Plugins and Plugin Manager

This setup uses Vim 8.0's native package management. Plugins are installed at `~/.vim/pack/default/start/`.

This is the list of plugins I use:

```
mru.vim/
vim-commentary/
vim-searchindex/
vim-sanegx/
```
