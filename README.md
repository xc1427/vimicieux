# vimicieux
Personal vim settings.

I used to be a hardcore vimer. Now I switched to IntelliJ IDEA and VSCode. Mostly because vim lacks some important modern IDE feature. When I managed to configure it right, I feel overwhelmed. 

I occasionally use vim for instant file viewing / editing / scripting. 

## How To Use

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/xc1427/vimicieux.git
echo "source ~/vimicieux/vimfile/sensible_cxi.vim" >> .vimrc
```



## About Plugins and Plugin Manager

Personally I use TPope's Pathogen. It is an non-intrusive tool and easy to use. Here is the Quick Introduction on [how to config](<https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#installation>). 

This is the list of plugins I put in `~/.vim/bundle` :

```
mru.vim/
vim-commentary/
vim-monokai/
vim-searchindex/
```
